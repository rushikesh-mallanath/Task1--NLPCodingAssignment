She works as a schoolteacher and describes her symptoms as worsening under stress, which she initially dismissed as anxiety. A thorough evaluation revealed mild asthma, along with borderline high cholesterol levels. Emily is 41 years old, 5'5\" (65 inches) tall, and weighs 172 lbs. She also complains of intermittent joint stiffness in her hands, particularly in the mornings, which her physician suspects could be early osteoarthritis. Emily’s sedentary lifestyle and inconsistent exercise routine have contributed to her struggles with maintaining a healthy weight, though she remains committed to improving her overall health with proper guidance and treatment.''',\n",

She has a history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and recurrent migraines, both of which have intensified over the past year. Karen also experiences chronic fatigue and joint pain, leading her physician to investigate possible early-stage rheumatoid arthritis. She reports frequent episodes of dizziness and occasional heart palpitations, which have been attributed to mild anemia and elevated stress levels. Karen’s symptoms are exacerbated by her demanding job as a paralegal, where long hours and poor posture have contributed to persistent neck and shoulder tension.
